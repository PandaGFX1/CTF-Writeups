# Description
CTF@CIT is an annual CTF challenge hosted around April 25th, 2025. Many challenges ranged from beginner to more advanced leveling. While most of the challenges were fun, some of the flags found could have been more obvious to alert you that you had solved the challenge. Nonetheless, we have enjoyed CTF@CIT and look forward to next year.
